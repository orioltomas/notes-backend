<h1>NOTES BACKEND</h1>

Download or clone this repository to check notes application backend.

To try it out you have these commands that need to be run from the root of the project.

Start the server:
<code>npm start</code><br>
Start the server that restarts itself when any change on the code is made:
<code>npm run dev</code><br>
If you have both frontend and backend, you can run that serves frontend static files through the backend:
<code>npm run deploy && npm start</code><br>
Like this you can access 'http://localhost:3001' and you will have frontend and backend together.
